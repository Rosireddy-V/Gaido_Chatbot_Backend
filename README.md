# Gaido_Chatbot_Backend
The bakend is deployed on Render. I am using free tier for this.
- [Link for the AI assistant](https://chatbot-ui-red-three.vercel.app/) When you ask a question and at that time the free instance will spind down with inactivity on render. So don't worry if it is taking time to generate the answer. Generally it takes more time for the first question and after that it produces the responses very fastly.
